<H1>Settings</H1>

<HR>

Under Unix, the settings window appears directly after starting Frodo, or by
pressing F10. Under BeOS, the settings window can be brought up by selecting
the "Settings..." menu item in the running emulation.<P>

<H2>Drives</H2>

In the box <B>"Drive Paths"</B>, there are four fields, each corresponding
to one of four emulated 1541 drives with the drive numbers 8, 9, 10 and 11
(normally you only need drive 8). For every drive, there is a <EM>path entry
field</EM> and a <EM>button</EM>.<P>

Frodo offers three different modes for drive emulation (see <A
HREF="files.html">here</A> for details):<P>

<UL>
<LI><EM>Directory Mode</EM>, where the contents of a directory of the host
file system are made available to the emulated C64 as a "pseudo disk".
<LI><EM>Disk Image Mode</EM> uses a binary dump of a 1541 floppy disk in the
.d64 or x64 disk image format for providing true, sector-by-sector floppy
emulation. This is the preferred mode with the highest compatibility.
<LI><EM>Tape/Archive Mode</EM> makes the contents of a .t64 tape image file,
a LYNX archive file, or a single .p00 program file available to the emulated
C64 as a "pseudo disk".
</UL>

The <B>path entry field</B> holds either the path name of a directory,
the path name of a .d64/x64 image file, or the path name of the .t64/LYNX
archive file. Under BeOS, you may also drop Tracker icons to the entry field.
The drive emulation mode is selected automatically depending on the type of
the selected file or directory.<P>

The button labeled <B>"Browse..."</B> opens a file selection dialog for a
more comfortable selection of directories and .d64/x64/.t64/LYNX files.<P>

If <B>"Enable Full 1541 Emulation"</B> is turned on, the four emulated 1541s
are disabled and replaced by a single 1541 emulation (drive 8) that only
operates on .d64/x64 files, but emulates the entire 1541 hardware and is
compatible with most fast loaders and some forms of copy protection.
However, it has considerably slower disk access and can also slow down the
emulation. If you have a .d64 with a program that doesn't load with the
normal emulation (see above), you may have better luck with the full 1541
processor emulation instead.<P>

With <B>"Map '/' &lt;-&gt; '\' in file names"</B> you control whether the
'/' in C64 filenames will be translated to '\' and vice versa for Directory
Mode drives. The '/' character is used to access subdirectories under
Unix/BeOS, but as the C64 doesn't have subdirectories, it's a valid part of
a C64 file name. This is a problem if a program wants to create a file with
'/' in it as the host system would interpret the part before the '/' as a
directory name and, finding no such directory, would return an error and
the operation would fail. If you activate this checkbox all '/'s will
transparently be translated into '\', so in directory listings the '/' will
still appear. If you turn off this option, you can of course use the '/' to
access files in subdirectories from the C64.<P>

<H2>Video/Sound</H2>

With <B>"Display Type"</B> you can choose whether the emulation runs in a
window or in full-screen mode.<P>

<B>"Doublescan Lines"</B> is only available under BeOS for the "Screen"
display type. It removes the black lines between scanlines, but makes
the emulation a bit slower.<P>

With <B>"Display Sprites"</B>, you can switch the display of sprites on and
off.<P>

<B>"Detect Sprite Collisions"</B> determines whether collisions between
sprites and between sprites and graphics should be detected. Turning off
collisions will make you invincible in some games (sadly, your enemies are
likely to become invincible, too <TT>:-/</TT>).<P>

The <B>"Sound Emulation"</B> selection controls the type of sound output.
<EM>"None"</EM> means no sound (faster), <EM>"Software"</EM> turns on the
software 6581 SID emulation. Under Linux, there is another option,
<EM>"Catweasel"</EM> for using a hardware SID chip on a Catweasel board (you
also need Catweasel kernel drivers for this).<P>

The <B>"Enable SID Filters"</B> field enables the software emulation of the
SID sound filters. Some C64 music may sound better with the filters
disabled.<P>

<H2>Input</H2>

<B>"Joystick Port 1/2"</B> specifies which joysticks you want to use for
each of the two C64 joystick ports (there is also a
<A HREF="keyboard.html">joystick emulation</A> on the numerical keypad).
You should only turn on the ports to which you have actual joysticks
connected, or the C64 keyboard will behave erratically. Frodo has an automatic
joystick calibration. If you plug in a new joystick or change the joystick
settings, you should first move the joystick once in each direction.<P>

With <B>"Swap joysticks"</B> you can swap the assignment of the joystick
ports of the host machine to the C64 ports without having to plug out and
in your joysticks. E.g. if a C64 game is using a joystick on C64 port 1 you
can simply activate "Swap joysticks" and use a joystick in port 2 on your
machine to play the game.<P>

<H2>Options</H2>

With <B>"Draw every n-th frame"</B> you can select if Frodo should skip
frames when displaying the C64 graphics. The normal setting is "1", that is,
every frame (every simulated raster beam sweep) is recalculated. If you
change this to "2", for example, then only every second frame is calculated,
immensely speeding up the display on slow machines, though some raster
effects may look a bit jerky. This setting can also be changed while the
emulation is running with the '+' and '-' keys on the numerical keypad.<P>

When the field <B>"Limit speed"</B> is active, the emulation is slowed down
when its relative speed exceeds 100%. If you set the value in "Every (n)th
frame" so that the speed is just over 100% and activate the speed limiter,
the emulation always runs at the original C64 speed, with the highest
possible precision. This setting can be toggled with the '*' key on the
numerical keypad.<P>

With the setting <B>"Fast Reset"</B> you can disable the memory test that
is normally performed by the C64 on a reset, and which takes about three
seconds. Under emulation, the memory test is not necessary and resetting the
C64 (F12) gets much faster when it is disabled.<P>

<B>"REU size"</B> sets the size of the REU (RAM Expansion Unit) emulated by
Frodo or turns the REU emulation off ("None"). Very few programs actually
use the REU (operating systems like ACE and GEOS, and some utilities), so
you can usually leave this at the <EM>"None"</EM> setting.<P>

<H2>Advanced</H2>

The settings in this group are not available in Frodo SC.<P>

<B>"Cycles per line (CPU)"</B> and <B>"Cycles per Bad Line (CPU)"</B> set
the number of clock cycles available to the CPU per normal raster line and
per Bad Line. If a program is showing flickering lines or graphical flaws
you should try to slightly alter both values. For "Bruce Lee" you must
enter "62" for the "Cycles per line (CPU)".<P>

With <B>"Cycles per line (CIA)"</B> you can control the speed of the CIA
timers. Entering a higher value increases the frequency of cursor blinking
and key repeat. Some programs don't run correcly with the default value
(e.g. "Ballblazer" which needs a value of 65).<P>

<B>"Cycles per line (1541)"</B> sets the number of cycles available to the
1541 processor emulation per raster line. There is normally no need to
change this value. This setting has no effect if 1541 processor emulation
is turned off.<P>

The settings for the four "cycles" coming closest to an original PAL C64
are (63, 23, 63, 64).<P>

The setting <B>"Clear CIA ICR on write"</B> is necessary to make some
programs (such as the games "Gyruss" and "Motos") run that would otherwise
hang in an endless interrupt loop because they use an unusual technique to
acknowledge CIA interrupts (sometimes even without the programmer knowing
it). It should normally be turned off.<P>

<H2>Unix/BeOS/AmigaOS</H2>

Clicking <B>"Start"/"OK"</B> will start the actual emulation (or return
to it) and <B>"Quit"/"Cancel"</b> will discard your changes to the settings
and quit Frodo (or discard the changes and return to the emulation).<P>

<H2>BeOS/AmigaOS</H2>

With the menu items <B>"Open..."</B>, <B>"Save"</B>, <B>"Save As..."</B>
and <B>"Revert"</B> you can load and save the settings from and to
arbitrary files.<P>
