Frodo has not been updated for quite a while because I've been working on
other projects (GiNaC, Basilisk II, ...). However, I'm currently doing a
complete rewrite of the code for Frodo V5. It will use an event-based
emulation like UAE or VICE because the current line-based model has already
been stretched beyond its feasibility. Also, the fantastic SDL will be used
as the low-level graphics/sound/input library.
