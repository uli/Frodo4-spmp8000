<STRONG>Frodo</STRONG> is an open and free C64 emulator for BeOS, Unix,
MacOS, AmigaOS, Win32 and RiscOS systems and the world's first C64 emulator
not bearing a "64" in its name. <TT>:-)</TT><P>

Frodo comes in two <A HREF="flavours.html">flavours</A>: The regular
<STRONG>Frodo</STRONG> with a line-based emulation, and the single-cycle
emulation <STRONG>Frodo SC</STRONG> that is slower but far more
compatible.<P>

In addition to a precise 6510/VIC emulation, Frodo features a full,
processor-level 1541 emulation that is able to handle most fast loaders.
There is also an alternative, faster 1541 emulation of four drives in
.d64/x64 disk images, .t64/LYNX archives, or directories of the host
system.<P>

Frodo runs on a variety of platforms. The "core" distribution of Frodo
